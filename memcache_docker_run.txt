docker run -it --rm --name memcached -p 11211:11211 memcached -m 64 // for memcache backend
docker run -it --rm --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis // for redis backend

Memcached runs on port 11211 by default. The -p option is used to publish the 11211 port to the same
host interface port. The -m option is used to limit the memory for the container to 64 MB. Memcached
runs in memory, and it is allotted a specified amount of RAM. When the allotted RAM is full, Memcached
starts removing the oldest data to store new data. If you want to run the command in detached
mode (in the background of your terminal) you can use the -d option.


Usage of cache:
>>> from django.core.cache import cache
>>> cache.set('musician', 'Django Reinhardt', 20)
You access the default cache backend and use set(key, value, timeout) to store a key named
'musician' with a value that is the string 'Django Reinhardt' for 20 seconds. If you donâ€™t specify a
timeout, Django uses the default timeout specified for the cache backend in the CACHES setting.

Now, execute the following code:
>>> cache.get('musician')
'Django Reinhardt'

You retrieve the key from the cache. Wait for 20 seconds and execute the same code:
>>> cache.get('musician')
No value is returned this time. The 'musician' cache key has expired and the get() method returns
None because the key is not in the cache anymore.
