Q:
I see. dispatch method of Django views that do and return nothing by itself that is just According to the incoming HTTP methods, it redirects to the View's required get/delete/add methods. is it right?

A:
Yes, that's correct!
The dispatch method of a Django view is responsible for determining which method handler (get, post, delete, etc.) should be called based on the incoming HTTP request method.

Here's a high-level overview of how the dispatch method works:

When a request comes in, Django creates an instance of the appropriate view class.
Django calls the dispatch method of the view instance with the incoming request as an argument.
The dispatch method examines the request method (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE) and determines which method handler to call (e.g. get, post, delete, etc.).
The dispatch method calls the appropriate method handler, passing in the request, any captured URL parameters, and any additional keyword arguments that were passed to dispatch.
The method handler generates an HttpResponse object that represents the response to the request, and returns it to the dispatch method.
The dispatch method returns the response generated by the method handler back to Django, which sends it back to the client that made the request.
So the dispatch method acts as a sort of router, determining which method handler to call based on the request method, and delegating control to that method handler to generate the response.
The method handlers are responsible for generating the actual response content, while the dispatch method manages the overall flow of control.





                            Steps of working dispatch method in Django:
1. Dispatch determines the HTTP method and then redirects that request based on the appropriate HTTP method for example GET in a MyView
2. GET method inside MyView is executed and returns a particular response to the back dispatch method of Django
3. Dispatch method of Django returns the HTTP object returned by the GET method of MyView back to Django.
4. Finally, Django returns an HTTP object(example: home page) to a client.



                                    Answer for above steps:
Yes, that's essentially correct! Here's a more detailed breakdown of the steps involved in handling an HTTP request using a Django view:

When Django receives an HTTP request, it tries to match the URL of the request to a registered view.
If a view is found, Django creates an instance of the view class and calls its dispatch method with the incoming request.
The dispatch method examines the incoming request to determine its HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and then calls the appropriate method of the view instance to handle the request (e.g. get, post, etc.).
The method that is called generates an HttpResponse object with the appropriate response for the request, and returns it to the dispatch method.
The dispatch method then returns the HttpResponse object to Django, which sends it back to the client that made the request.
So in the case of a GET request to a MyView class, the steps would look something like this:

Django calls the dispatch method of the MyView instance with the incoming GET request.
The dispatch method determines that the request is a GET request, and calls the get method of the MyView instance to handle the request.
The get method generates an HttpResponse object with the appropriate response (e.g. "Hello, World!"), and returns it to the dispatch method.
The dispatch method returns the HttpResponse object to Django, which sends it back to the client as the HTTP response for the request.
